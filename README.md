# REST API with PHP and MySQL

This project is an implementation of a RESTful API using PHP to interact with a MySQL database for data storage. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

## Features
- Provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data in the MySQL database.
- Utilizes PHP's built-in functions and libraries to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Implements secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authorization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshilJO/PHP-API.git
   
   ```
2. Install dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Start the Apache server:
 
4. You can now access the API at http://localhost/.
